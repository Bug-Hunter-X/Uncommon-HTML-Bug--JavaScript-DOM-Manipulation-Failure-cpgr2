# Uncommon HTML Bug: Silent DOM Manipulation Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug where a JavaScript script attempts to manipulate a DOM element that might not exist, leading to a silent failure.

The bug is subtle because it doesn't immediately produce a visible error message. Instead, the expected DOM changes simply don't occur.

## Bug Description
The `bug.html` file contains a script that tries to modify the innerHTML of a div element ('myDiv'). If for some reason, the 'myDiv' element is missing or not loaded when the script runs, it throws an error, but this error isn't always reported to the user or logged visibly, resulting in an unexpected outcome.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates a robust way to handle this situation by checking if the element exists before attempting any manipulation.
